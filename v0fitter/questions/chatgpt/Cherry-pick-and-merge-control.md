# Cherry-pick and merge control

#### You:
git link commit on one branch to commit on another branch (i.e. merging but with more control which changes are merged)

#### ChatGPT:
You have a few ways to “merge” just the bits you want, without pulling in an entire branch’s history. The two most common approaches are:

---

## 1. Cherry‑pick individual commits

```bash
# 1. Check out the branch you want to receive the change:
git checkout target‑branch

# 2. Pull in one (or more) specific commits by SHA:
git cherry-pick <commit‑sha1> [<commit‑sha2> …]
```

- **Pros**
  - Pulls exactly the commits you name (no extra merges).
  - Keeps each picked commit’s metadata (author, date, message).
- **Cons**
  - If the same branch later merges wholesale, you may get conflicts or duplicates.

### Variations

- **No‑commit mode**: stage everything, then edit interactively
  ```bash
  git cherry-pick --no-commit <sha>
  # now your index and work‑tree reflect the changes,
  # but nothing’s committed yet.
  git add -p    # selectively stage hunks
  git commit    # author a single new commit
  ```

- **Range of commits**
  ```bash
  git cherry-pick A..B      # picks all commits after A up to and including B
  ```

---

## 2. Merge with “patch” (select hunks interactively)

If you want to merge a branch but choose hunks interactively:

```bash
# 1. Start a merge, but don’t commit:
git checkout target‑branch
git merge other‑branch --no-commit --no-ff

# 2. Undo staging of everything:
git reset

# 3. Interactively stage hunks from the other branch’s changes:
git add -p

# 4. Commit just what you staged:
git commit
```

This effectively lets you “merge” in pieces:

1. `--no-commit` stops Git from immediately making the merge commit.
2. `git reset` unstages all merge results, leaving files modified in your work‑tree.
3. `git add -p` walks you through each hunk—say “yes” to the ones you want.
4. `git commit` makes one commit containing only the selected changes.

---

## 3. Interactive rebase / `git rebase --onto`

If your feature branch has commits A→B→C but you only want B and C applied on top of another base:

```bash
# Suppose feature branched from commit X, and you want B & C onto base Y:
git checkout feature
git rebase --onto Y X feature
# Now feature’s history is Y→B→C
```

Then merge or fast‑forward that trimmed branch into your target.

---

### Which to choose?

- **Single, isolated commits** → `git cherry-pick SHA`
- **A sprinkle of hunks from many commits** → `git merge --no-commit` + `git add -p`
- **Rewriting a branch’s history to drop unwanted commits** → `git rebase --onto`

All three give you precise control over what lands where, without a blunt “merge all these changes.”


#### You:
what do you mean by this?

#### ChatGPT:

#### ChatGPT:

#### ChatGPT:
When you cherry‑pick a commit, Git takes the *patch* (the actual code changes) from one commit and re‑applies it as a *brand new* commit on another branch. That new commit has:

- A different SHA‑1 (because it’s literally a different commit object, even if the diff is identical),
- Potentially a different author date or committer metadata,
- And no Git‑internal record that “this came from commit X on branch A.”

Later on, if you do a normal `git merge branch‑A` into your target branch, Git will look at branch A’s commits and see that it contains that same patch again—only under its original SHA. Because your cherry‑pick and branch A’s original commit are *different* objects, Git won’t know they’re semantically the same change. Two things can happen:

1. **Duplicate code**\
   Git may happily apply that patch twice, so you end up with the same lines of code added or modified two times.
2. **Merge conflicts**\
   If the file has moved on since you cherry‑picked, Git sees “this change touches the same lines” in both histories and throws a conflict for you to resolve manually.

---

### How to avoid it

- **Don’t merge the original branch wholesale** once you’ve cherry‑picked its key commits. Instead, keep working off your target branch or merge only parts of it again.
- **Use a topic branch**:
  1. Create a small feature branch, cherry‑pick into *that*.
  2. Merge the feature branch (fast‑forward or squash) into your main line.
  3. Leave the “big” branch A alone—or merge it only after you’ve reconciled which commits you actually need.
- **Mark commits as already applied** via the “patch‑id” trick in some workflows (advanced).

In practice, the simplest way to steer clear of accidental duplicates or conflicts is: if you cherry‑pick from branch A, don’t later merge branch A in its entirety into the same branch. Pick one workflow—either cherry‑pick or full merge—but don’t mix them on the same commits.


#### You:
I do not plan on fully merging the branch into the branch I want to cherry-pick the commit onto. Is there an internal record in this case?

#### ChatGPT:

#### ChatGPT:

#### ChatGPT:
When you cherry‑pick a commit onto another branch, Git literally creates a brand‑new commit object with its own SHA.  There is no hidden “pointer” in Git’s commit graph tying that new commit back to the original one—unless you explicitly add one yourself.

The only “record” you get by default is the footer that Git can append to your commit message if you use the `-x` flag:

```bash
git cherry-pick -x <orig‑sha>
```

That will add a line like

> `(cherry picked from commit 3f4c5d2)`

to your new commit’s message.  But that’s just text in the message—Git doesn’t treat it as structured metadata, and it doesn’t show up in `git log --graph` as a real parent or ref.

Internally, during the cherry‑pick operation, Git does use a temporary ref called `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` to remember which commit you’re picking, but once the commit is made, that ref goes away.  Thereafter:

- **No parent link:** your new commit’s parent is whatever was at `HEAD` when you ran the cherry‑pick, not the original commit.
- **No built‑in trace:** Git won’t automatically know “these two commits have the same patch” unless you run a patch‑ID comparison yourself.

So—if you never plan to merge the “source” branch back in, you effectively lose any structural connection between the two commits.  The only thing that persists is whatever you choose to write in the commit message (e.g. via `-x`), or any notes/tags you manually add (e.g. with `git notes`), to remind yourself where it came from.


#### You:
Is there a record kept in this case?

#### ChatGPT:
When you do:

```bash
git merge other‑branch --no-commit --no-ff
git reset
git add -p
git commit
```

Git is still “in merge” when you finally run `git commit`, so it creates a **merge commit** with two parents:

1. The tip of your **target** branch
2. The tip of **other‑branch** (stored temporarily in `.git/MERGE_HEAD`)

Once that merge commit is written:

- **Parent pointers** in the commit graph permanently record “this commit merged in other‑branch.”
- The temporary `MERGE_HEAD` ref is cleaned up, but the two-parent link stays.

What **isn’t** recorded:

- **Which hunks** you chose or skipped. Git doesn’t annotate a merge commit with “I only applied lines 10–20 of `foo.c`.”
- Any patch‑ID metadata—only the raw commit graph link.

---

### If you truly want *no* merge record

Use a **squash merge** instead:

```bash
git merge other‑branch --squash
git commit
```

A squash merge:

- Applies all changes from `other-branch` into your working tree
- Lets you edit and stage hunks however you like
- Then creates a **normal** (single‐parent) commit
- Records *no* parent link to `other‑branch`

But of course it also suppresses any hint in the graph that “this commit came from other‑branch.”

---

**Summary**

- The interactive‑hunk workflow still gives you a two‑parent *merge* commit, so Git knows you merged `other‑branch`, even if you only brought in some hunks.
- There’s no finer‐grained record of exactly which hunks you picked—just the merge link plus whatever you write in your commit message.


#### You:
I am no longer in merge mode after running these commands, i.e. git doesnt try to create a merge commit. Why is that?

#### ChatGPT:
Great question — and you're absolutely right to notice something's off.

Let’s walk through what’s *actually* happening with:

```bash
git merge other-branch --no-commit --no-ff
git reset
git add -p
git commit
```

### 🔍 What's *expected*:

After `git merge --no-commit --no-ff`, Git should enter **merge mode** — meaning:

- It stages the combined tree (if auto-merge succeeds),
- It *does not* create a commit,
- It leaves metadata in `.git/MERGE_HEAD`,
- And when you later run `git commit`, it knows to make a **merge commit** (with two parents).

### 💥 But `git reset` breaks that

When you run:

```bash
git reset
```

You're doing a **soft reset** (by default), which:

- Moves the index to match `HEAD` (i.e., it *unstages* everything),
- Leaves the working directory untouched (so changes are still visible),
- And **clears merge state** — i.e., it **removes `.git/MERGE_HEAD` and other merge metadata**.

That’s the key. Once `.git/MERGE_HEAD` is gone, Git no longer thinks it’s in a merge. So when you run:

```bash
git commit
```

...Git just creates a **normal commit** (with one parent), and the fact that this came from `other-branch` is lost — **no merge commit is created**.

---

### ✅ If you want to selectively stage hunks but still make a proper merge commit:

Use this slight tweak:

```bash
git merge other-branch --no-commit --no-ff
git reset HEAD   # <- note: not plain `git reset`
git add -p
git commit
```

- `git reset HEAD` only resets the **index**, not merge metadata.
- It keeps `.git/MERGE_HEAD` intact, so `git commit` still knows it’s a merge.
- You can then stage hunks interactively and write a proper merge commit.

---

### 🧠 TL;DR

You’re not in merge mode anymore because:

> `git reset` (without arguments) clears the merge state, making Git forget it was in the middle of a merge.

Use `git reset HEAD` instead to preserve merge mode while clearing the index.


#### You:
Merge mode not preserved even after doing git reset head

#### ChatGPT:
When you ran

```bash
git merge other-branch --no-commit --no-ff
git reset HEAD
```

you actually cleared out Git’s merge metadata (`.git/MERGE_HEAD`), so by the time you did `git commit` Git saw no merge in progress and made a normal one‑parent commit.

---

## How to unstage without aborting the merge

The trick is to only reset *paths*, not the whole merge state. There are two equivalent ways to do this:

### 1. Use `git reset HEAD -- .`

```bash
git merge other-branch --no-commit --no-ff
git reset HEAD -- .      # <-- note the “-- .” here
git add -p               # interactively stage hunks
git commit               # now this will produce a two‑parent merge commit
```

- `git reset HEAD -- .` tells Git: “for all files (`.`) unstage whatever’s in the index, but leave merge metadata alone.”
- You’re still “in merge,” so `git commit` produces a proper **merge commit** (two parents).

### 2. Use `git restore --staged .` (Git 2.23+)

```bash
git merge other-branch --no-commit --no-ff
git restore --staged .   # new porcelain command to unstage files
git add -p               # pick hunks
git commit               # two‑parent merge commit again
```

- `git restore --staged .` only touches the index, never the merge state.
- Semantically identical to `git reset HEAD -- .` but more explicit in newer Git.

---

### Why your previous `git reset HEAD` cleared the merge

When you omit the `-- <paths>` or `-- .`, `git reset` defaults to “mixed” reset of **all** tracked files *and* can clean up merge‐in‐progress state (it sees no paths specified and assumes you want to rewind to `HEAD` entirely). Specifying the paths prevents that.

---

With either of the above, you’ll stay in merge mode, selectively stage hunks, and end up with a **true merge commit** that records both parents—even though you only picked some of the hunks.
