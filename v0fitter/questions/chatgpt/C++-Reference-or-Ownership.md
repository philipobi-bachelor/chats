# C++ Reference or Ownership

#### You:
How to implement a c++ member that is either a reference or stores the object itself

#### ChatGPT:
Below is one way to create a member that can either refer to an external object or own its own copy of that object. The key idea is to store:

1. A pointer (or reference‐wrapper) to “the actual” object you’ll use at run‐time.
2. A small, optional storage (e.g. `std::optional<T>`) that “holds” an owned copy if needed.

At access time, you redirect reads/writes to the pointer: if you’re in “owning” mode, the pointer is initialized to the address of your internal storage; if you’re in “referencing” mode, the pointer points to the external object.

Below is a minimal, self‐contained example of such a class template `MaybeOwn<T>`. You can adapt it to your own needs (e.g. add more constructors, support iterators, etc.).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <optional>
#include <utility>

/**
 * MaybeOwn<T> can either:
 *   – “Refer” to an existing T (without taking ownership), or
 *   – “Own” its own T (by storing a T inside itself).
 *
 * Internally, it keeps:
 *   1) std::optional<T> _storage;    // when we want to own a T
 *   2) T*                _ptr;       // always points to the current T
 *
 * If we’re in “own” mode, we emplace into _storage and set _ptr = &_storage.value().
 * If we’re in “ref” mode, we set _ptr = &external.
 */
template <typename T>
class MaybeOwn {
public:
    // --- Constructors for "reference" mode ----------------------------

    /// Construct so that we merely refer to 'obj' (no ownership).
    explicit MaybeOwn(T& obj) noexcept
        : _storage(std::nullopt),
          _ptr(&obj)
    {}



```
