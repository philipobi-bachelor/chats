#file:RecoTrack.h  #file:RecoHitInformation.h What is the difference between the RecoHitInformations sorting parameter and the created track point ID. Why do these values not match sometimes? How is the sorting parameter of a RecoHitInformation determined?

Variables: `file:RecoHitInformation.h`, `file:RecoTrack.h`

#### GitHub Copilot (claude-sonnet-4):

Looking at these two header files, I can explain the differences between the sorting parameter and the created track point ID:

## Sorting Parameter vs Created Track Point ID

### **Sorting Parameter** (`m_sortingParameter`)
- **Purpose**: Defines the **logical order** of hits within a RecoTrack
- **Scope**: RecoTrack-specific ordering concept
- **Usage**: Used to sort hits in the order they should appear along the track trajectory
- **When set**: Assigned when a hit is added to the RecoTrack (e.g., via `addCDCHit()`, `addSVDHit()`, etc.)
- **Range**: Typically starts from 0 and increments sequentially
- **Persistence**: Stable throughout the track's lifetime

### **Created Track Point ID** (`m_createdTrackPointID`)
- **Purpose**: References the **index** of the corresponding `genfit::TrackPoint` in the underlying `genfit::Track`
- **Scope**: GenFit-specific internal identifier
- **Usage**: Maps RecoHitInformation to actual track points in the fitted track
- **When set**: Created during track fitting when measurements are generated from hits
- **Range**: GenFit internal indexing (can be -1 if no TrackPoint created)
- **Persistence**: Can change during refitting or track modifications

## Why They Don't Always Match

Several reasons explain why these values may differ:

1. **Pruned Hits**: Some hits may be marked as "pruned" (`setUseInFit(false)`) and won't create TrackPoints, but retain their sorting parameter

2. **Fitting Failures**: If DAF (Deterministic Annealing Filter) removes hits during fitting, those hits won't have corresponding TrackPoints

3. **GenFit Internal Logic**: GenFit may reorder or skip TrackPoints based on its internal algorithms

4. **Track Modifications**: Operations like `prune()` or `deleteFittedInformation()` can invalidate TrackPoint IDs while preserving sorting parameters

## How Sorting Parameter is Determined

The sorting parameter is explicitly set when adding hits to a RecoTrack:

````cpp
// Example from the addCDCHit method signature:
bool addCDCHit(const UsedCDCHit* cdcHit, const unsigned int sortingParameter, ...)

// When copying hits between tracks:
size_t addHitsFromRecoTrack(const RecoTrack* recoTrack, 
                           unsigned int sortingParameterOffset = 0,
                           bool reversed = false, ...)
````

The sorting parameter represents the **intended physical order** of hits along the particle trajectory, typically:
- Starting from the innermost detector layers (PXD) outward
- Following the particle's path through the detector
- Maintained even if some hits are later excluded from fitting

This design allows the RecoTrack to maintain logical hit ordering independent of GenFit's internal track point management.
