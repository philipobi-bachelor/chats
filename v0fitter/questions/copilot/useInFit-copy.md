#file:RecoTrack.h  Is the useInFit attribute of the RecoHitInformation objects copied when using addHitsFromRecoTrack?

Variables: `file:RecoTrack.h`

#### GitHub Copilot (claude-sonnet-4):

Looking at the `addHitsFromRecoTrack` method and the `addHit` template method in the RecoTrack class, I can see that **yes, the `useInFit` attribute is copied** when using `addHitsFromRecoTrack`.

Here's why:

1. The `addHitsFromRecoTrack` method iterates through all RecoHitInformation objects from the source track and calls the `addHit` template method for each hit.

2. The `addHit` template method creates a new `RecoHitInformation` object by calling:
   ```cpp
   RecoHitInformation* newRecoHitInformation = recoHitInformations.appendNew(hit, params...);
   ```

3. This calls the RecoHitInformation constructor with the original hit and all the parameters from the source RecoHitInformation, which would include the `useInFit` attribute along with other attributes like:
   - `RightLeftInformation`
   - `OriginTrackFinder` 
   - `sortingParameter`
   - And importantly, the `useInFit` flag

The `addHitsFromRecoTrack` method essentially performs a deep copy of all the hit information, preserving all attributes of the original RecoHitInformation objects, including the `useInFit` attribute that determines whether a hit should be used in track fitting.

However, note that if `optionalMinimalWeight` is specified, only hits with weights above that threshold are copied, which could filter out some hits that might have `useInFit` set to false due to low weights from previous DAF fitting.
