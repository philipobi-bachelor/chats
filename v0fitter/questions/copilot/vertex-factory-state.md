#file:GFRaveVertexFactory.cc #file:GFRaveVertexFactory.h Does the VertexFactory preserve any state in between calls to the `findVertices` method or is it safe to call multiple times?

Variables: `file:GFRaveVertexFactory.h`, `file:GFRaveVertexFactory.cc`

#### GitHub Copilot (claude-sonnet-4):

Looking at the code, the `GFRaveVertexFactory` does maintain state between calls to `findVertices`, but it's designed to be safe for multiple calls.

## State Management

The key state that's maintained is:

1. **`IdGFTrackStateMap_`** - A map that stores copies of track state information
2. **`factory_`, `magneticField_`, `propagator_`** - The underlying RAVE objects that persist

## Safety for Multiple Calls

The `findVertices` methods are **safe to call multiple times** because:

1. **Automatic cleanup**: Each `findVertices` call starts and ends with `clearMap()`, which:
   ```cpp
   void GFRaveVertexFactory::clearMap() {
     for (unsigned int i=0; i<IdGFTrackStateMap_.size(); ++i)
       delete IdGFTrackStateMap_[i].state_;
     IdGFTrackStateMap_.clear();
   }
   ```

2. **Exception safety**: Even if an exception occurs during vertex finding, `clearMap()` is called in the catch block to ensure cleanup.

3. **Fresh state per call**: The `IdGFTrackStateMap_` is rebuilt from scratch for each `findVertices` call via `GFTracksToTracks()`.

## Persistent Configuration

Some configuration persists between calls (which is intentional):
- Beamspot settings (via `setBeamspot()`)
- Reconstruction method (via `setMethod()`)
- Verbosity and propagator type (set in constructor)

**Conclusion**: It's safe to call `findVertices` multiple times. The factory properly manages temporary state cleanup while preserving configuration settings.
