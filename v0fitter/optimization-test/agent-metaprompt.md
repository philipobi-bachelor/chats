#### philipobi:
I would like to task an AI agent with improving the performance of the V0Fitter #file:V0Fitter.cc #file:V0Fitter.h to make it faster. However, the improved version should still produce exactly the same results as the current version. The processes in the V0Fitter that take the most time are creating copies of objects and running fitting algorithms, especially track fitting. Therefore, it would be best to avoid unnecessary fitting and copying of large objects. The agent should only modify code if it leads to significant performance gains and doesnt change the fundamental logic of the code. What should the prompt I pass to the AI agent look like? The agent can autonomously read and edit files added to the context, so it should directly modify the code instead of suggesting changes in the chat.

Variables: `file:V0Fitter.h`, `file:V0Fitter.cc`

# Prompt for AI Agent to Optimize V0Fitter Performance

```
Your task is to optimize the performance of the V0Fitter implementation in tracking/v0Finding/fitter/ without changing its functionality. Focus specifically on the files V0Fitter.cc and V0Fitter.h.

Requirements:
1. The optimized code MUST produce EXACTLY the same results as the original implementation.
2. Your primary focus should be reducing execution time by optimizing these key bottlenecks:
   - Minimize unnecessary copying of large objects (especially RecoTracks and genfit::Tracks)
   - Reduce redundant track fitting operations which are computationally expensive
   - Optimize memory usage patterns

3. Look for specific opportunities to:
   - Cache results that are recomputed unnecessarily
   - Avoid repeated object creation/destruction in loops
   - Use references instead of copies where appropriate
   - Identify and eliminate redundant operations
   - Optimize the removeInnerHits and vertexFitWithRecoTracks functions which are performance critical
   - Consider if any track fitting or copying can be skipped based on prior results

4. For each optimization you implement:
   - Add a brief comment explaining the performance improvement
   - Ensure backward compatibility and identical outputs
   - Preserve the fundamental algorithm logic

5. Only make changes that will lead to measurable performance improvements.

Make the necessary modifications directly to the code. Focus on algorithmic and structural optimizations rather than micro-optimizations. The goal is to significantly reduce execution time while maintaining exact result consistency.
```

This prompt provides clear guidance for the AI agent to focus on the most impactful performance optimizations while ensuring the functional behavior remains unchanged. It directs the agent to the most promising areas for improvement without requiring manual intervention.
